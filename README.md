# Feature_Engineering_Categorical_Feature


1. Handelled the missing values of continuous Feature with the help of Arbitary Imputation
2. Handelled the missing values of Categorical Feature with the help of Frequent Category Imputation
   In This technique I replaced the nan values with the mode value
3. Handelled the missing values of Categorical  Feature with the help of  adding a new feature to keep the impotance of missingness

4. When I had more number of nan values i handlled this by  creating a new feature having name "Missing"
5. Performed One Hot Encoding
6. Performed Ordinal Number Encoding by creating a DataFrame of Days with the help of inbuild Library of Pandas Datetime
7. Performed Count/Frequency Encoding
8. Performed Target Guided Encoding
